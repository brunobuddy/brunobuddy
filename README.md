## Bonjour 👋🏼

I am Bruno, a senior TypeScript developer and entrepreneur. 

Co-founder of [Buddyweb](https://buddyweb.fr), a digital agency and [Manifest](https://manifest.build), an open-source backend-as-a-service. I am located in [Grenoble](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=grenoble#map=9/45.017/5.757) 🇫🇷🏔🫕 with a strong personal and professional attachment to Paris 🗼.


- ⚙️ I work mainly with `.ts`, `.tsx`. Sometimes with `.scss` but I am not so proud of it 
- ❤️ I love Open Source, learning and drinking beers (when I can find the time for it)
- 🌱 I am currently improving my DevOps skills, I feel like I missed so many things 😳
- 📫 Reach me through GitHub, follow me and I'll follow you back
